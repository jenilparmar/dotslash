## 📌 Overview
Managing NoSQL databases like MongoDB can be complex, especially for small businesses and home-based enterprises. Our platform simplifies this by integrating **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Blockchain technology** to provide a secure, no-code solution for database operations.

## 🔥 Key Features
### 🤖 **NLP-Based Database Operations**
- Users can perform **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations simply by typing a request in natural language.
- Our trained NLP model intelligently identifies the requested operation and executes it automatically, eliminating the need for coding.

### 🔒 **Blockchain-Powered Security**
- **Smart Contracts** ensure that **database connection strings remain confidential**.
- Users can grant or revoke access permissions for specific users securely.
- This ensures complete control over database access without exposing sensitive credentials.

### 🔄 **Blockchain-Based Revert System**
- Tracks and records database operations in a **transparent, immutable ledger**.
- Enables authorized users to **roll back unintended changes**, ensuring **data integrity and security**.
- Provides a verifiable history of database modifications for auditing and trust.

## 🏆 Benefits
✔ **No-Code Solution** – Perform database operations effortlessly using natural language.  
✔ **Secure Access Control** – Blockchain smart contracts safeguard sensitive information.  
✔ **Data Recovery** – A transparent, blockchain-backed revert mechanism prevents data loss.  
✔ **Ideal for Small Businesses** – Simplifies database management without requiring technical expertise.  

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **User Inputs Request** – Example: *"Retrieve all customer orders from last week."*
2. **NLP Model Analyzes the Request** – Determines if it’s a Create, Read, Update, or Delete operation.
3. **Database Operation is Executed** – The system performs the requested action securely.
4. **Blockchain Ensures Security** – Smart contracts manage access, and changes are logged.
5. **Revert System Available** – Users can reverse actions transparently when needed.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps to Set Up DistilBERT Model

### Step 1: Create a Conda or Python Environment
We recommend using Conda. Use the following command to create an environment:
```sh
conda create -p name_of_environment -y
```
Then, activate the environment:
```sh
conda activate name_of_environment
```
If that doesn’t work, try:
```sh
conda activate path_of_environment
```

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
Run the following command to install dependencies from the requirements file:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Fine-Tune the Model
Execute the fine-tuning script on a custom dataset (`shuffled_db.csv`) using:
```sh
python fine_tuning.py
```

### Step 4: Deploy the Model on a Flask Server
Once fine-tuning is complete, deploy the model using:
```sh
python app.py
```

Your BERT model is now set up and ready to go!
